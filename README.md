## Requiremets:

The builder needs to be run inside windows

    1. GO - 1.25.x

    2. Garble (https://github.com/burrowers/garble)
        Install:  go install mvdan.cc/garble@latest

## Usage:

    1. Compile the builder
        go build .

    2. Execute the builder
        .\breakend-builder.exe

    3. Copy the 2 executables that are inside the "release" to a safe location


## NOTES:
The RSA keys is autogenerated so if you delete an executable you need to compile each executable again manually

#### Compile a single component:

    1. CD to the component dir (encryptor|decrytor)

    2. Execute
        garble -literals -tiny build .

    3. A new executable is generated, save it to a safe place
